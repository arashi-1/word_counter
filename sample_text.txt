The Coffee That Knew Too Much

In the quiet town of Nibblewood, where nothing ever happened and people liked it that way, something very unusual took place on a Tuesday morning.

Harold, a retired librarian with a mustache that could sense rain, was sipping his usual black coffee when he noticed the mug whispering.

Yes—whispering.

He leaned closer.

"They’re watching you, Harold."

Harold blinked.

"Pardon?"

"The squirrels. Don't trust them."

He looked out the window. Sure enough, three squirrels were sitting perfectly still on his fence—tiny acorns in paw, staring straight at him.

Was it the caffeine? The expired yogurt? Or was his mug trying to warn him of something bigger?

Determined, Harold set out to investigate. He wore his trench coat (even though it was 90°F) and followed the squirrels. They led him deep into the park, past the playground, past the duck pond, and into a hollowed-out tree.

Inside? An underground squirrel command center.

There were maps, blueprints, surveillance footage... of Harold. Apparently, they’d been monitoring him for years because of one critical incident:

He once returned a library book two years late—a book on how to defend yourself from squirrel attacks.

“They knew too much,” he whispered to himself.

The squirrels turned and looked at him.

Then… he woke up.

The coffee was still warm. The squirrels were gone. His mustache? Still twitching.

But from that day on, Harold always returned his books on time—and switched to tea.
